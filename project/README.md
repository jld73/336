I would like to work with Jesse.
The idea that we had was to create a filesharing chatroom. This page that would allow users to submit messages with a name (which would be saved via cookie), a message, and an optional file upload that would add the file to the database in in the BSON format, and cause the chat message to display a link to download the file (restricted to 16 megabytes due to the low capacity of the sandbox, and the restrictions of the BSON format). This would allow images, documents, and other small files to be shared easily between a group. If you think this would be too complicated, our other idea was (instead of allowing file upload) checking each message for any urls that point to images, and automatically rendering those images within the html of the page. This would simplify the database interactions, but would make the app something more than just a re-tooling of the comment page we did in lab.
